		Essaouira is <b><span style="color:#009800;">a port city on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean</span></b> with a population of around 77,966. Between 1912 and 1956 (period of the French protectorate of Morocco), it was called <b>"Mogador"</b>, a name derived from the regional <u>saint Sidi Mogdoul</u>. and after the independence of Morocco in 1957, the name of the city was changed to Essaouira which means <b><span style="color:#009800;">the castle immured by a wall</span></b>.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essaouira has a very beautiful and diverse nature, located particularly on the <b>islet of Mogador</b>, and the areas around the city. In 1980 the islet of Mogador was designated a<b> biological reserve</b>. It is a natural and ornithological site of which it is home to several species of birds such as gulls, great cormorants, grouse and crows, in addition between April and October 700 very rare pairs of Eleonore hawks come to reproduce there before leaving for Madagascar.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Essaouira is also distinguished by <b><span style="color:#009800;">the argan tree</span></b>. Only found in Morocco, it also is the city's main plant wealth and occupies a very important position in the region due to its ecological, social and economic role. In fact, the tree provides environmental, cosmetic and physiological benefits, and produces argan oil that is popular all over the world due to its use in <b>cosmetics</b>.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city also has <b>a mild climate</b> that makes it more wonderful, as it is very similar to the climate of the southern California coast, such as Los Angeles and San Diego. in short, its climate is pleasant throughout the year with very mild and slightly rainy winters and pleasantly hot and dry summers with no excessive heat because the ocean is very cool.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to its geographical location and its natural and cultural wealth, it is considered one of <b><span style="color:#009800;">the most important tourist cities in Morocco</span></b>. Indeed, since the end of the 20th century, Essaouira has experienced a spectacular renaissance due mainly to tourism and the medina of Essaouira has been listed as a<b><span style="color:#009800;"> UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001</span></b>.
